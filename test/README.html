    <h4>Take-home javascript exercise</h4>
    
    <p>In this folder you will find a simple html page and accompanying js/css files:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="index.html">index.html</a></li>
        <li>api.min.js</li>
        <li>udsTable.css</li>
        <li>yourJsFile.js</li>
    </ul>
    <p>api.min.js contains some methods for you to use to simulate retrieving data, as well as a helper method for building a table from a datasource.
        You will use yourJsFile.js to complete some steps for fetching data, processing it, and presenting it. You will find a comment and a couple lines
        there already, providing documentation on the data api methods and the table helper method.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Get names and counts from the data api, and combine them into one data source.</li>
        <li>Add another field to the data: percent of total. It should equal count divided by the total of all counts. For example, if the total of all counts is 200, a data item might have { count: 5, percentOfTotal: .025 }</li>
        <li>Using the table helper method, create a table from this data showing name, count, and the percent of total. Format the last as a percentage, with 2 decimal places (e.g. "2.50%").</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Try to minimize the complexity of the algorithms you use for each step.</p>
    <p>When you are finished, zip up all the files and attach them in a reply. I should be able to simply open index.html and see your solution in action. Good luck!</p>
    <p>Extra credit items:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Show an error message if the data retrieval fails.</li>
        <li>Show an indication on the page while the data is still loading.</li>
        <li>Sort the list alphabetically (how efficiently can you do this? Hint: memory is cheap, time is not)</li>
        <li>That table sure looks awful, doesn't it? If you feel like it, feel free to spruce it up a little by adding some rules to udsTable.css.</li>
    </ul>
